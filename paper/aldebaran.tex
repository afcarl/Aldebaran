\section{Introduction}

Aldebaran, or $\alpha$~Tauri, is a well-known first-magnitude naked-eye red giant star, and has long been the subject of astronomical investigations. Following the proposal of \citet{struverv} several groups began to search for planets by the radial velocity (RV) method, looking for Doppler shifts from the star's reflex motion around the common centre of mass, culminating in the discovery of 51~Peg~b \citep{51peg}, the first exoplanet to be recognized as such. Before this, \citet{hatzes1993} noted RV variations in Pollux \citep[$\beta$~Gem; subsequently confirmed as a planet:][]{betgemconf,betgemconf2}, Arcturus ($\alpha$~Boo, unconfirmed), and Aldebaran. After further investigation by \citet{Hatzes1998}, \citet{Hatzes2015} now claim a firm RV detection of a planetary-mass companion Aldebaran~b, with a period of $628.96 \pm 0.90$~d. 

In this paper, we present a re-analysis of these original RV data in which we not only confirm this signal, but detect acoustic oscillations in Aldebaran for the first time. We validate this method and its result with new RV observations with the SONG~Telescope, and photometry from the \ktwo Mission. By measuring the frequency of maximum power ,\numax, of these \emph{p}-mode oscillations we asteroseismically determine the mass of Aldebaran to be $1.16 \pm 0.07$~\msun. This measured stellar mass allows us to calculate that any moons of this giant planet, although they are now likely to be very hot, may have had equilibrium temperatures comparable to that of the Earth when Aldebaran was on the main sequence, raising the possibility that they may have once been habitable.

Our new approach to asteroseismic data analysis, based on Continuous Auto-Regressive Moving Average (CARMA) models, can extract exoplanet signals together with measures of \numax from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series. An all-sky survey planetary companions to precisely measure the masses of all nearby red giant stars is feasible with this new approach, and the required data either already exist in large exoplanet surveys, or are easy to obtain with ground-based telescopes.

\section{Asteroseismology of Red Giants}
Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for the charaterisation of red giant stars \citep[see][for a detailed review]{2013ARA&A..51..353C}.  Red giants are solar-type pulsators, they exhibit acoustic modes of oscillation that are both excited and damped by stellar convection.  In the frequency-power spectrum of either radial velocity of photometric observations, these modes of oscillation form an often intricate pattern of sharp peaks where the properties of the pattern can be mapped back to intinsic stellar properties \citep[e.g.,][]{2016AN....337..774D}.  The easiest properties of the pattern to determine are the the frequency of maximum amplitude \numax and the so-called large separation \Dnu \citep{1995A&A...293...87K}.  The two observables are often referred to as the global average seismic parameters.

Stellar properties can be determined with the average seismic measures and effective temperature \teff.  A set of scaling relations exist that illustrate the constraint the global asteroseismic measures provide.  These scaling relations are understood to be approximate but never the less are commonly used for radius $R$, mass $M$, and surface gravity $g$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\left( \frac{R}{\mathrm{R_{\odot}}} \right) \simeq & \left( \frac{\nu_{\rm max}}{\nu_{\rm max, \odot}} \right) \, 
\left( \frac{\Delta \nu}{\Delta \nu_{\odot}} \right)^{-2} \, \left( \frac{T_{\rm eff}}{T_{\rm eff, \odot}} \right)^{0.5}, \\
\left( \frac{M}{\mathrm{M_{\odot}}} \right) \simeq & \left( \frac{\nu_{\rm max}}{\nu_{\rm max, \odot}} \right)^{3} \, 
\left( \frac{\Delta \nu}{\Delta \nu_{\odot}} \right)^{-4} \, \left( \frac{T_{\rm eff}}{T_{\rm eff, \odot}} \right)^{1.5}, \\
\left( \frac{g}{\mathrm{g_{\odot}}} \right) \simeq & \left( \frac{\nu_{\rm max}}{\nu_{\rm max, \odot}} \right) \, 
 \left( \frac{T_{\rm eff}}{T_{\rm eff, \odot}} \right)^{0.5}. \\
\end{eqnarray}
While the accuracy of these scaling relations is still a matter of ongoing work \citep[e.g.,][]{2017ApJ...844..102H}, stellar parameters can be estimated by comparing observables to parmaeter from models of stellar evolution. 

As can be seen from the scaling relations, asteroseismology can provide constraint on Mass, Radius, and surface gravity if \Dnu, \numax, and \teff can be measured.  In practise, for the higher luminosity red giants it is more straight forward to measure \numax than \Dnu.  Typical values for \numax might range from $0.1$ to $20 \rm \mu Hz$ for the luminous giants and $20$ to $50 \rm \mu Hz$ for red giants with luminosities similar to the red clump .  For the same sets of stars, \Dnu would take ranges from $0.02$ to $3 \rm \mu Hz$ and $3$ to $7 \rm \mu Hz$ depending on stellar mass and \teff (or metallicity which is considered more fundamental) \citep[e.g.,][]{2011A&A...525L...9M, 2013A&A...559A.137M}.  Hence, \numax requires less frequency resolution than \Dnu to establish a good measurement.

The ability to measure \numax and \Dnu, therefore, depends on the length and sampling rate of a data set.  For regularly spaced data, typically analysed using an estimate of the frequency-power spectrum, the Nyquist limit and frequency resolution are trivial to estimate.  For the historic data sets proposed here the typical length is \guy{blah} and typical sampling is \guy{blah}.  This in principle gives us access to measures of \numax for \guy{these types of stars} and \Dnu $\,$ \guy{for those types of stars}. 

\section{Time-Domain Models}

It is easy to observe Aldebaran and similarly-bright stars with ground-based spectroscopic instruments, typically only requiring short exposures that can be obtained even under adverse observing conditions. There is indeed a considerable archive of such observations already, as a legacy of radial velocity (RV) surveys conducted to find exoplanets. In most cases, however, these have not so far been useful for asteroseismology, because these RV data are sparsely and irregularly-sampled. Because we have to pause observations during the day, during poor weather conditions, or simply when targets of higher priority are being observed, we get time series of only a few points and which may have significant and uneven gaps. This introduces a window-function effect: the power spectrum as constructed for example by a Fourier transform, or a Lomb-Scargle Periodogram \citep{lomb,scargle}, is convolved with the Fourier transform of the window function, introducing strong sidelobes adjacent to real frequency peaks and causing crosstalk between adjacent frequency channels. This imposes significant limitations both on the signal-to-noise and frequency resolution of power spectra derived from linear methods such as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and in practice makes asteroseismology difficult or impossible from the ground for stars with oscillation frequencies ranging from $\sim 12$~h to $\sim$~a few days. 

If we apply nonlinear statistical inference methods...

\section{Aldebaran}
Aldebaran is a red giant star with spectral type K5, one of the nearest such stars at a distance of only $19.96 \pm 0.38$~pc \citep{hipparcos}. Its position near the Ecliptic permits the determination of its angular diameter by lunar occultations and by interferometry \citep[$20.58 \pm 0.03$ mas;][]{richichi2005,1979ApJ...228L.111B,brown1979,panek1980}.

\subsection{SONG Observations}

\subsection{K2 Observations}

In order to verify the results of the novel analysis presented above, we sought to obtain an independent detection of the oscillations of Aldebaran and compare the frequencies determined with the two methods. 

Aldebaran was therefore observed with the \ktwo Mission \citep{howell14}, a two-wheeled revival of the \kepler Mission \citep{2010sci...327..977b}, under Guest Observer Program 130471 in Campaign~13, from 2017-03-08 to 2017-05-27. 

As Aldebaran is extremely bright, it saturates the \kepler detector and it is therefore not possible to use standard photometry pipelines to extract a K2 lightcurve. We instead use halo photometry \citep[as originally implemented in][]{White2017}, whereby unsaturated pixels from the outer part of the large and complicated halo of scattered light around bright stars are used to reconstruct a light curve as a weighted linear combination of individual pixel-level time series, as described in Appendix~\ref{halo}. 

Using the \textsc{k2ps} planet-search code \citep{k2ps,Pope2016} to examine this light curve, we search for transits across a wide range of periods, and find no evidence either of short-period planetary transits or an eclipsing stellar companion.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

We have determined the stellar properties of Aldebaran with the additional constraint of \numax determined from our analysis here.  The details of the stellar modelling are presented in detail in \ref{sec:mod}.  We have considered the impact of our additional \numax constraint and run our analysis for different sets of spectroscopic estimates.  For final values we adopt the Sheffield et al. (2012) b spectrosocpic solution as being 'middle of the road' estimates.  For the analysis without constraint on \numax we find estimates of the stellar propeties as $M = 1.43^{+0.24}_{-0.2} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and age $4.86^{3.56}_{2.04} \, \rm Gyr$.  With the inclusion of \numax we find $M = 1.16^{+0.07}_{-0.07} \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and age $6.38^{1.42}_{1.12} \, \rm Gyr$.  It is clear that the addition of \numax provides substatially more precise estimates of Mass and Age.  

We note that with the determination of the stellar mass it is possible to infer the parameters Aldebaran had while it was on the main sequence. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation, drawing masses randomly from a Gaussian distribution $M \sim \mathscr{N}(1.17,0.05)$ to predict the luminosity of the main-sequence progenitor, and the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.  %Using the scaling relations of \citep{eker2015}, we find that Aldebaran would have had a luminosity $L_* = 2.0 \pm 0.37~\lsun$ on the main sequence.  
Using the Mesa Isochrones and Stellar Tracks \citep[MIST:][]{mist0,mist1}, models, we compute the luminosity and radius evolution of the planet along the main sequence with uncertainty both in stellar mass (this work) and metallicity \citep[$-0.15 \pm 0.2$; ][]{decin2003}. $L$ evolves from $2.03 \pm 0.56$~\lsun at 0.5~Gyr to $2.74 \pm 0.93$~\lsun at 2.5~Gyr.

We note that this implies that the planet at a semimajor axis of $1.512 \pm 0.021$~AU would have been subject to an insolation comparable to that of the Earth, evolving from 0.5~Gyr to 2.5~Gyr from $0.89 \pm 0.22$ to $1.19 \pm 0.37$ times that of the Earth today. Subject as well as this to the great uncertainties of the planet's orbital evolution and albedo, this planet and any of its moons may well have had temperate environments now long-since destroyed by their host star's evolution away from the main sequence.

\section{Halo Photometry}
\label{halo}

The \kepler Space Telescope \citep{2010sci...327..977b}  
suffered a critical reaction wheel failure in May 2013, which made it impossible to maintain a stable pointing and therefore continue its nominal mission. It was revived as \ktwo \citep{howell14}, balanced by orienting perpendicular to the Sun. This requires that \ktwo observes fields in the Ecliptic in $\sim~80$~d Campaigns. 

The \kepler detector saturates for stars brighter than the $\sim~11^\text{th}$ magnitude. Nevertheless, the excess flux deposited in a saturated pixel spills conservatively up and down the pixel column, such that it is possible to sum this `bleed column' for bright stars and still obtain precise photometry, such as was done for the brightest star in the nominal \kepler mission, $\theta$~Cyg \citep{guzik2011,thetacygwhite,guzik2016} ($V = 4.48$). There are two main reasons why this is not possible for all bright stars in general. First, because the downlink bandwidth from \kepler is very limited, it is often not desirable to download the large pixel stamps as are required for such bright stars; these must be even larger in \ktwo to account for the reduced image stability. Second, if the bleed column for a sufficiently bright star reaches the edge of the chip, flux spills over and is not conserved, imposing a hard brightness limit that depends on the distance to the detector edge. 
Collateral `smear' data, which are collected to help calibrate the photometric bias from stars sharing the same column as a target, can be used to reconstruct light curves for un-downloaded bright stars and thereby avoid bandwidth constraints \citep{k2smear}, but these data are still rendered unusable if the bleed column falls off the edge of the chip and contaminates the smear rows.

Bright stars have a wide, complicated, position-dependent point spread function (PSF) arising from diffraction and scattering from secondary and higher-order reflections inside the instrument, with the result that they may contaminate thousands of nearby pixels with significant flux. We can therefore use this `halo' of unsaturated pixels for photometry. The brightness of this halo varies in the same way as that of the primary star, and we therefore obtain data in a region of 20~pixel radius around the mean position of Aldebaran, and discard saturated pixels.
In this paper we proceed as in \citet{White2017}, in which the method was demonstrated on the seven bright Pleiades, with only minor changes.

The flux $f_i$ at each cadence $i$ is constructed as a weighted sum of pixel values $p_{ij}$:

\begin{equation}
	f_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M} w_j p_{ij}.
\end{equation}

\noindent We choose the weights $w_j$ such that they lie between 0~and~1, add to unity, and minimize the Total Variation (TV) of the weighted light curve. In the continuous case, $n$-th order TV is defined as the integral of the absolute value of the $n$-th derivative of a function; in the discrete case, replacing the derivative with finite differences, first-order TV becomes

\begin{equation}
\text{TV} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} |{f}_i - {f}_{i-1}|}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} {f}_j}
\end{equation}

\noindent and likewise second-order TV the equivalent expression in second-order finite differences. 

In an improvement since \citet{White2017}, we use the \textsc{Theano} library \citep{theano} to calculate analytic derivatives for this objective function, which reduces the computational time for a single halo light curve on a commercial laptop from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. 

As a final step to reduce residual uncorrected systematics, we apply the \textsc{k2sc} \citep{k2sc} Gaussian Process-based systematics correction code to the initial halo light curve, but the effect of this in the present case for Aldebaran is minimal.
There is somewhat higher than usual residual noise at multiples of $4 c/d$ (the satellite thruster firing frequency), but this is nevertheless very small in comparison to the signal from Aldebaran, and may be ascribed to the large fraction of the pixel mask occupied by the bleed column from this extremely bright star.
