\section{SONG Observations}    % this goes into section 4.1

In order to detect the oscillations of Aldebaran via the radial velocity 
method we used the Hertzsprung SONG telescope \cite{grundahl2017}. All 
observations were carried out in the highest resolution mode (R$\approx\,110.000$)
with an integration time of 30s. The observations were carried out between 27 September 
2016 and  12 January 2017, during this time we attempted to obtain at least one 
visit per available night. A total of 254 spectra was obtained. The spectra were
extracted using the SONG pipeline (see \cite{Grundahl2017}). SONG employs an iodine cell for
precise wavelength calibration and the velocities were determined using the $\it iSONG$
software following the same procedures as described in \cite{Grundahl2017}.   The typical
velocity precision per visit is 2.5$m\,s^{-1}$ allowing us to easily detect the oscillations
which displays a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\approx\,$170$m\,s^{-1]$. $\bf Figure XX$ show
the radial velocities obtained -- oscillations are easily visible as well as a long-term
trend. This is probably due to the a manifestation of the planetary companion reported by
\cite{Hatzes2015}. 

%% Suggestion(s):
%% Show a plot of the RV-curve, similar to the K2 light-curve plot.
%% In the Introduction: I suggest to add a reference to SONG (use the Grundahl et al. 2017
%% given below.

%% The last sentence in the Introduction:  I suggest to clarify that the ground-based datasets
%% either existing or to-be-obtained will be for the radial-velocity method (I think that 
%% ground-based photometry will not be sufficiently accurate).
